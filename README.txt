This repo contains my code, written for SoftUni final exams. 
It is being updated all at once, as its purpose is to be shared with potential employers.
For all courses, except C# Web Basics, exercise and exam solutions are automatically graded by their Judge evaluation system. (judge.softuni.bg)
This grade does not include code quality.

The C# Web Basics course exam is manually checked and graded with code quality taken into account.

Notes:
SoftUni does not keep a record of the Technology Fundamentals Nov 2018 Exam solutions. That is why I have uploaded all course exercise solutions and problem definitions.
